### Part 1 – Ideas
*Bryce*: You could look at in-season tournament stats for the NBA. The courts are all different colors that are super bright colors and honestly could throw the players off and make their stats worse. 

*Will*: Sports betting would be difficult to do because many sports betting sites have restrictions on what data you can access. You might be able to find an API somewhere but prize picks might be blocked off and if it is you could try draft kings. 


### Part 2 - Blog Post on Data Collection

*Mary Nydegger*: Good read and very clear and simply describes your analysis which is awesome. I liked how you showed the specific steps you did for each thing to gather and clean your data. I also liked how clear your ethical considerations section was. One recommendation would be to actually link your websites so people can click on them to take them somewhere. You can do that by typing this: [whatever words you want to link to the website](website url).

### Part 4 - Streamlit App

*Mary Nydegger*: I really like how you had the filters on the side, and how your entire dashboard would update with those filters. I think that was the perfect approach for this kind of project in being able to view the data and distributions. I think this genuinely is a type of app that people would find helpful when looking for neighborhoods to fit their interests… whether they’re looking for houses available or certain styles or things. One thing someone recommended to me that also could be useful is adding a sentence or 2 with st.write() to each visualization to describe what you’re looking at and how the results apply. I think that would be more helpful for those who don’t have a technical background. 

*Ryan*: I spoke with Ryan in person and he asked about the number of homes for sale in each location. I did not have that chart added, so that could be something to include. He said the functionality looked great and overall was a solid app. 



### Changes

#### Ideas
I cycled through a few different ideas from analyzing sports betting to exploring differences between In-Season Tournament and Season stats for the NBA to eventually analyzing home prices. Home prices was something I was very curious about especially since the market has continued to rise consistently for some years now. I wanted to see the differences between cities and counties. 

#### Post on Data Collection
Based off of my feedback there wasn't much to change besides making my links accessible. I fixed that so it should be good to go.
